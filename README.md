# Sobre❤️

I've always been curious about the programming area, but I was afraid to start with things I heard and my financial condition as well. I had my first computer when I was 16, that's when I started digging lol, but it didn't last long because it broke hahaha. So most of my time I watched programming videos on my cell phone, but I never had direct contact with codes, not to mention that I didn't understand about it. After a while, I got a job and started studying Systems Analysis and Development, even though I didn't have a computer. From this attitude, my life took a turn, I created the courage to go after other alternatives, not to mention the friendships I made with wonderful people who helped me in this process. It was there that I tried proa, an institution that teaches Java web development, and for me it was the best place I found, where I got to know real programming and had even more desire to be in the technology area. On the bow, I developed wonderful personal skills that I didn't know I was capable of, it literally changed my life, and since then I've been discovering more and more about this wonderful area. I like the opportunity that this technology offers people, and the proposal to make life easier, unfortunately knowledge is something that not everyone has access to, but all the knowledge I've been getting I try to pass on to other people who are interested, because all learning in this area is excellent. area, and it has to be shared.
